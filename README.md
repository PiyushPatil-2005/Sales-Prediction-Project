#  Advertisement Sales Prediction Project Using Logistic Regression

This project is aimed at predicting whether a customer will buy a product based on their age and salary using logistic regression.

## Introduction

The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information about customers' ages, salaries, and their purchase decisions. Logistic regression is employed as the predictive model.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Initial setup where necessary libraries are imported.
2. **Choose Dataset File**: Instructions to choose the dataset file from the local directory.
3. **Load Dataset**: Loading the dataset using pandas.
4. **Summarize Dataset**: Displaying basic information about the dataset.
5. **Segregate Dataset**: Splitting the dataset into input (independent variables) and output (dependent variable).
6. **Splitting Dataset into Train & Test**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. **Feature Scaling**: Scaling the features to ensure equal contribution to the model.
8. **Training**: Training the logistic regression model.
9. **Predicting New Customers**: Predicting whether a new customer will buy based on their age and salary.
10. **Prediction for Test Data**: Predicting purchase decisions for all test data.
11. **Evaluating Model**: Evaluating the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## Usage
